                             Mercury Options

Overview

HSTP must be designed to allow for modular information, as the control messages
sent will expand in scope. To do this, we send over a preliminary header, which
contains data universal in control messages. Appended to this header is a
dynamic number of options. Each options is specified by a type, gives a length in bytes,
and contains data specific to that option.

Structure of the HSTP Header Packet:

char[alias_size = 18]     alias           <--- Name of sender, if less than 18 octets must be filled with \0.
uint_16                   options_length  <--- Length of all options in octets including headers.
uint_8                    num_of_options  <--- # of options

This is then followed by a dynamic number of options:

Option Header:
uint_8                type
uint_16               option_length
char[option_length]   data

Options

(ID: 0) Echo

  Debugging tool used to test functionality. Sender expects nothing,
  receiver logs the message to the logger for debugging.
  Debugging tool used to test functionality. Sender expects receiver
  to send back what was sent.
  Len: Variable
  Data:
    - char[len_of_message] message

(ID: 1) Establishment

  Represents if this is the first or last message with a client.

  Len: 36
  Data:
    - uint8_t start_or_stop
      - is 0 on start and 1 on stop
    - uint16_t mftp_port
      - only relevant on start, filled with 0s on stop
    - uint8_t has_password
      - is 0 if no password and 1 if has password
    - char[32]
      - 32 bytes representing the password as a SHA-256 hash.
      - all 0s if no password.

(ID: 2) Chat

  Represents a chat message being sent.

  Len: Variable
  Data:
    - char[18] alias_of_chatter
    - uint32_t len_of_message
    - char[len_of_message] message

(ID: 3) Stream Title

  Represents a message containing the (new) stream title.

  Len: Variable
  Data:
    - char[len_of_message] title

(ID: 4) Viewer Count

  Represents a message containing the (updated) viewer count.

  Len: sizeof(uint32_t) = 4
  Data:
    - uint32_t viewers

(ID: 8) Performance Metric Request
  
  Only sent by a host. Contains the current time so that the receiving
  client can calculate network latency. Should be sent periodically. Expects
  an ID: 9 Metrics response.

  Len: 8
  Data:
    - uint64_t current_ms_since_epoch

(ID: 9) Performance Metrics

  Only sent by a client. Represents a bundle of information about network
  performance. Reponse to an ID: 8 request.

  Below, "recent average" refers to that property being the average of the
  time since the data was last requested.

  Len: 14
  Data:
    - uint16_t latency (in ms)
    - uint32_t throughput (in bits per second recent average, technically goodput)
    - float loss (as a percent - lower is better)
    - float fps (true frames display per second recent average) (float = 4 bytes)
