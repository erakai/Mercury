                             Mercury Options

Overview

HSTP must be designed to allow for modular information, as the control messages
sent will expand in scope. To do this, we send over a preliminary header, which
contains data universal in control messages. Appended to this header is a
dynamic number of options. Each options is specified by a type, gives a length in bytes,
and contains data specific to that option.

Structure of the HSTP Header Packet:

char[alias_size = 18]     alias           <--- Name of sender, if less than 18 octets must be filled with \0.
uint_16                   options_length  <--- Length of all options in octets including headers.
uint_8                    num_of_options  <--- # of options
<--- Options --->

Option Header:
uint_8                type
uint_16               option_length
char[option_length]   data
