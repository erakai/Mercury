Overview

HSTP must be designed to allow for modular information, as the control messages
sent will expand in scope. To do this, we send over a preliminary header, which
contains data universal in control messages. Appended to this header is a
dynamic number of options. Each options is specified by a type, gives a length in bytes,
and contains data specific to that option.
